## Thomas Analysis of Summer School' 2017 Data
Here I focus on data analysis sampled during Summer School 2017 in Agali forest.
Any collected data belong to greenhouse gas emissions by grey alder stems during the experiment phase. Basically, the experiment consisted of three periods - before, during, and afterartificial irrigation of the forest.
